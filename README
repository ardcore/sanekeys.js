javascript keyboard sanitizer.
to be used in html5 games, mostly.

it's _not_ finished, optimized & tested. but it works.

API may change.

Basic usage:

    sanekeys.setKeys({
        'w': function(e) {
            debug("going up");
         },
        's': function(e) {
            debug("going down");
         },
        'a': function(e) {
            debug("going left");
         },
        'd': function(e) {
            debug("going right");
         }
    })

TODO:
 - support for the rest of the keyboard (,./ etc.. nothing fancy, I don't want to
 deal with system-specific issues. probably will have to anyway ;>)
 - overrides: testing and fixing
 - dealing with propagations
 - parsing human-readable keystrings to keycodes. all-lower, a+b equals two
keys at once (difference: few millis), a(b) equals `holding a press b`. nesting?
 - modifiers: isShift... etc
 - lastTimePressed with parameters (key)
 - combos. afterCombo("w+space,w,w(space)", 10) - second parameter is maximum time
